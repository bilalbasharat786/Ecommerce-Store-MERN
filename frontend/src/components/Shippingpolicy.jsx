      <h1 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-center">Shipping Policy</h1>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This Shipping Policy describes Bilal Storeâ€™s practices and procedures for shipping
        and delivering orders purchased through our website. Please read this policy carefully
        before placing an order. By placing an order on Bilal Store you agree to the terms set
        out below.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Scope</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This policy applies to items purchased on BilalStore.com. It covers domestic shipments
        within Pakistan and any international shipment options explicitly offered at checkout.
        Shipping options, rates and delivery times may vary by product, seller, and delivery
        destination.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Order Processing Time</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Orders are typically processed within 1â€“3 business days after payment confirmation.
        Processing time may increase during peak seasons, holidays, promotional events, or
        where additional verification is required. If processing of your order will take
        longer than expected, we will notify you at the email address or phone number provided
        at checkout.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Shipping Methods & Carriers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bilal Store partners with trusted courier and logistics providers. Available carriers
        and delivery options will appear at checkout. Carrier selection depends on the
        destination, parcel size, service availability and any service level selected by you.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Shipping Rates</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Shipping fees are calculated at checkout based on the selected shipping method, package
        weight and delivery address. We may offer promotions for free or reduced shipping;
        such promotions will be stated at checkout or on our website.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Estimated Delivery Times</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Estimated delivery times are provided as a guideline only and commence from the date of
        dispatch (i.e., when the package leaves our warehouse). They do not include processing
        time described above. Delivery estimates:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Local (within main cities): 2â€“5 business days</li>
        <li>Inter-city (within Pakistan): 3â€“7 business days</li>
        <li>International: subject to courier and customs, typically 7â€“21 business days</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Delivery estimates may change due to holidays, customs clearance, weather, or carrier
        disruptions. We are not liable for delays beyond our reasonable control.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. Order Tracking</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Once your order ships, we will email or SMS a tracking number and a link to the carrierâ€™s
        tracking page. Tracking updates are provided by the carrier and may not be available
        immediately. If tracking is not updating, please wait 24â€“48 hours and check again.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. Shipping Restrictions</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Some products cannot be shipped to certain locations due to legal, safety, or carrier
        restrictions. Prohibited items will be clearly identified on the product page. We reserve
        the right to cancel or refuse shipments to restricted addresses.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">8. Customs, Duties & Taxes (International)</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For international shipments, customs duties, import taxes or fees may apply on delivery
        and are the responsibility of the recipient unless stated otherwise. Bilal Store is not
        responsible for delays caused by customs clearance or for additional fees charged by
        customs authorities.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">9. Delivery Attempt & Failed Delivery</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Carriers typically attempt delivery once or more depending on their terms. If delivery
        cannot be completed, the carrier may leave a notice with instructions for collection or
        re-delivery. Unclaimed shipments may be returned to sender; returned-to-sender parcels
        may incur return shipping charges and restocking fees, which will be deducted from any
        refund.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">10. Damaged or Lost Shipments</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If your shipment arrives damaged, please:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Do not accept the package if damage is severe and note the damage on the carrierâ€™s delivery receipt.</li>
        <li>Take clear photos of the packaging and damaged items immediately.</li>
        <li>Contact our support at <a href="mailto:officialbilal707@gmail.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">officialbilal707@gmail.com</a> with order ID, photos and details within 48 hours of delivery.</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For lost shipments, contact our support and the carrier. We will initiate an investigation
        and work with the carrier to locate the package or process a claim.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">11. Incorrect Shipping Information</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The customer is responsible for providing accurate shipping information. If you provide
        incorrect address details and the package cannot be delivered, additional reroute or
        redelivery charges may apply. Contact our support as soon as possible if you need to
        change delivery details.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">12. Multiple Items & Split Shipments</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Orders with multiple items may be shipped separately depending on availability and warehouse
        location. Shipping charges and delivery times are shown per shipment at checkout.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">13. Shipping Promotions & Free Shipping</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Free shipping promotions have terms and conditions (minimum order value, eligible products,
        geographic restrictions). Any promotion-specific conditions will be displayed at checkout.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">14. COVID-19 (or other health-related) Disruptions</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        During public health events or unexpected crises, delivery timelines may be extended.
        Bilal Store will communicate delays and work with carriers to minimize disruption.
